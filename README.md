# SunFlower Detector With DeepLearning(CNN)




## Description

- Using common convolutional models such as AlexNet, RestNet, VGG, GoogleNet to distinguish sunflower from other flowers based on Kegel dataset.



## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mtgama/SunFlower_Detector.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd SunFlower_Detector
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```py
        pip install tensorflow
    ```
4. Download Model from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fvNsWgpWvsFBzruMr528hETNcZhy_R81?usp=sharing

5. after download model, replace it in model directory and open ```load_model.ipynb```

## Usage

To run the project, open ```load-model.ipynb``` and run it.
- test model directory contain many flower for testing model.
- model in exist in **model** directory
